## 🟡 Current Blocking Issue

### Error: Insufficient API Credits

**Error Message from API**:
```json
{
  "error": "Failed to generate program with AI",
  "message": "Claude API Error: 400 {\"type\":\"invalid_request_error\",\"message\":\"Your credit balance is too low to access the Anthropic API. Please go to Plans & Billing to upgrade or purchase credits.\"}"
}
```

**Impact**: All AI features return error "Failed to generate program with AI" when users try to use them.

**Root Cause**: The Anthropic API account associated with the API key has no available credits.

**Solution Required**: Add credits to Anthropic account

---

## 📋 Action Required

### Step 1: Add Credits to Anthropic Account

1. **Visit Anthropic Console**: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/plans

2. **Sign in** with the account associated with API key:
   - API Key: `sk-ant-api03-cDLwwgCn...` (starts with)

3. **Add Credits**:
   - **Recommended for Testing**: $10 (200-300 requests)
   - **Recommended for Development**: $50 (1,000-1,500 requests)
   - **Recommended for Launch**: $100+ (2,000-3,000 requests)

4. **Or Upgrade to Paid Plan**:
   - Automatic billing
   - No interruptions
   - Higher rate limits

### Step 2: Verify Credits Added

Test the API directly:
```bash
curl -X POST https://www.plcautopilot.com/api/generate-plc-ai \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "description": "Simple motor start stop with emergency stop",
    "plcModel": "TM221CE16T"
  }'
```

Expected response: Valid PLC program JSON (not error message)

### Step 3: Test All Features

Once credits are added, test these pages:

1. **M221 Generator**: https://www.plcautopilot.com/m221-generator
   - Enter: "Motor start-delta starting sequence"
   - Should generate program

2. **AI Co-Pilot**: https://www.plcautopilot.com/ai-copilot
   - Ask: "Generate a conveyor belt control program"
   - Should receive detailed response

3. **Application Generator**: https://www.plcautopilot.com/ai-application-generator
   - Enter requirements
   - Should generate complete application

4. **Code Optimizer**: https://www.plcautopilot.com/ai-code-optimizer
   - Paste PLC code
   - Should receive optimization analysis

5. **Library Manager**: https://www.plcautopilot.com/ai-library-manager
   - Search: "motor control"
   - Should show AI-powered results

6. **Engineer Chat**: https://www.plcautopilot.com/engineer-chat
   - Ask technical question
   - Should get expert response
